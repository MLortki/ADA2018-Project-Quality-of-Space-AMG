Zurich is the largest city in Switzerland settled for over 2000 years. Located at the tip of the lake Zurich, it mesmerizes visitors  and inhabitants with its magnificent landscapes of lake, mountains and rivers. It is a home of numerous  museum and art galleries including, but not limited to, Zurich Museum of Art, Swiss National Museum and Centre le Corbusier. On the either side of the Limmat One can find numerous historic sites such as Â Lindenhof and Imperal Palace. Zurich is also cluttered with dozens of churches, parks and gardens.

<br>

Zurich stands out not only with its nature, art and aesthetic qualities, but it is also considered as the hub of Switzerland. Zurich serves as a connection point for railways, buses and airplanes. It is considered as one of the global markets and  as an important financial center despite its small size and population.

<br>

Zurich counts 400,028 inhabitants in total with around 32% of them not being Swiss citizens. Therefore, the city is very diverse and combines people with different cultures, nationalities and heritage. Since there are several popular universities such as ETH and PHW Business school, Zurich is also home for many talented young people as well as professionals with years of experience, families and retired individuals who want to enjoy every second remaining in their life.

Since Zurich is so diverse in terms of population (ages, backgrounds, nationalities, wealth etc.) and space, some of you may wonder how it is structured. What can we learn from this structure for knowledge transfer or what can we potentially improve for better life in Zurich? To answer these questions we need to identify characteristics and metrics of quality of life and space, study their spatial distribution and connection between metrics. We also need to portray people, their preferences, their life styles. We need to group them and study their groups. Only then, can we investigate metrics and people in one frame, connect groups of people with areas they occupy and search for reasons why. This data story is a bride between the quality of space and the people who live in the area. This data story, is the story of Zurich. Its people. Its spaces. Its life.

## Insurance data

The Swiss Mobiliar dataset is a private collection of anonymized insurance data, which groups information about a client and their house and car. It contains the following schemas: anonymous ID, status of employment, civil status, gender, year of birth, if house is owned or rented, speaking language, nation of origin, zip code of residence, how many children, canton of car matriculation, brand of car, price of car, car cylinder capacity, number of car claims, monetary value of car claims, premium class status of car, zip code of house, insured sum of house, standard of furniture, number of rooms in house, building zip code, insured sum of building, year of construction, type of house, number of claims for house, money of claims, premium class status of house. <br><br>

There are around 1M entries in the Swiss Mobiliar dataset, however when narrowing to the zip codes of Zurich, the number of entries is reduced to around 50 000. <br><br>

Among the information provided, found employment status, civil status, gender, year of birth, if house is rent or own, nationality (Swiss vs Non-swiss), number of children, information about carownershipm information about property ownership most relevant to our study and we further explored the data in those areas. <br><br><br>
