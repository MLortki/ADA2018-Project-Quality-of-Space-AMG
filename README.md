# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

Quality of space has been extensively studied across various disciplines as it addresses urgent societal issues of our time. Previous research provides evidence of social, economic and well-being measures being the main influencers. The goal of our project is to present models that can be used to describe quality of space on a postal code level in Switzerland starting from individual insurance customerâ€™s data. Currently different quality of space parameters are often calculated on a much more coarse-grained scale than postal codes (e.g., for regions, provinces or whole countries). Our goal is to complement this information and to provide analysis on a finer scale than previous research. For this project, we will focus on some Swizerland's economic heart: Zurich. 

The information gathered through this model could then be used either by city policy makers or business partners in order to improve societal well-being, through smart city planning. Thus, insurance datasets could provide insight into the panorama of human life through the lens of wellbeing, social cliques, urban safety and they could potentially uncover bigger socio-economic patterns and urban trends. In a sense, this project aims to replace the outdated and costly method of population censuses, to explore the trends and patterns of urban life.


# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 

- Deciding for relevant metrics for quality of life apart from the obvious ones such as building density, crime rate, mobility, green space density.
- Identifying indicators of quality of life that can be best predicted by the insurance data
- Observation of socio-economic patterns or urban trends in Zurich and answering questions (including but not limited to):
Do young people live in areas with more bars/restaurants or do they prefer green places (with more parks for instance.) Are postal areas with higher average house and car premiums more protected than other areas. (In terms of police offices)? Can we observe a preferential treatment in terms of for instance number of street lights, pools or nurseries and kindergarten? Do churches attract older people or is it evenly distributed. Are they located in areas with less night life? Are people in areas with high number of viewpoints/fountains/parks wealthier (identified by their car and houses). Do wealthier postal codes have more nuseries and schools?


# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

The following datasets will be used:

- Swiss Mobiliar dataset
- data.stadt-zuerich.ch (list of dataset at the end of ReadMe)


The Swiss Mobiliar dataset is a private collection of anonymized insurance data, which groups information about a client and their house and car. It contains the following schemas: anonymous ID, status of employment, civil status, gender, year of birth, if house is owned or rented, speaking language, nation of origin, zip code of residence, how many children, canton of car matriculation, brand of car, price of car, car cylinder capacity, number of car claims, monetary value of car claims, premium class status of car, zip code of house, insured sum of house, standard of furniture, number of rooms in house, building zip code, insured sum of building, year of construction, type of house, number of claims for house, money of claims, premium class status of house.

There are around 1M entries in the Swiss Mobiliar dataset, however when narrowing to the zip codes of Zurich, the number of entries is reduced to around 50 000.

To evaluate quality of space at the zip code level in Zurich, data is taken from the open source Zurich city dataset. The data is obtained via the website, and the following quantities per zip code area will be of particular interest for this project: number of buildings, number of parks, number of restaurants/cafes/bars, number of sport facilities etc.. Metrics of quality of space will be constructed from these quantities, based on the literature, but we expect to add new metrics such as building density or fraction of green space.



# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

- Obtaining all of the geolocalized data from the city of Zurich dataset.
- Cleaning, structuring and preparing city of Zurich data for analysis.
- Constructing relevant metrics for quality of life.
- Wrangling of the Insurance dataset: choosing relevant data entries by zip code.
- Looking for zip code level complementary datasets. If found, cleaning and structuring.
- Extracting descriptive statistics for both the Zurich data and the Insurance data (and others if found).
- Dealing with any data inconsistencies, based on descriptive statistics.
